# Setup

You need a recent NodeJS installation with either npm or yarn as a package manager as well as Python 3.6.
To build the debugger just run `npm install` followed by `npm run build` in the top level directory.
For yarn just replace `npm` with `yarn`.

The `dist` directory now contains the fully build debugger.

# Running

Run `bridge.py` and open `index.html` in a browser.
